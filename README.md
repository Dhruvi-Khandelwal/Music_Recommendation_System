# Music Recommendation System

This project implements a **Music Recommendation System** using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to analyze user preferences and recommend music based on the data provided.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Model Training
- Evaluation of Recommendation Accuracy
- Visualization of Results

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Music_Recommendation_System.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset by following the instructions in the notebook.
2. Preprocess the data using the provided functions.
3. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
4. Review the generated recommendations.

## Project Structure
- `Music_Recommendation_System.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code for the system.
- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset (not included in the repository).

## Results
The system evaluates the recommendations using various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and visualizes the results for better understanding.
